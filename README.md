# JS Task List
Welcome to my simple task list that I've created for learing purpuses.
This project is a part of entry level online course for Frontend developers that I'm participating in.
This project is in polish.

Thank You for stopping by.

In this project I'm using *javascript* and *flex*.
## What's inside?
My task list is built on a simple form with one input and a submit button.
List of records apears beneth the form, each record with two buttons, one to mark task as done and one to delete the task form the list.
